# `video.ts`

This is a simple video-player completely written in `typescript` and this is an inspiration from both
the epic video-players **NETFLIX** & **YOUTUBE**, I call it a mixture.

> **Note**: Please place your video file inside the `public/videos/` folder &
> then reference the video at `/src/components/VideoPlayer/index.tsx:222` (line 222)

## TODO

- [ ] An online demo.
- [ ] Add video references at `src/app/page.tsx` rather than in the component itself
