# `video.ts`

This is a simple video-player completely written in `typescript` and this is an
inspiration from both the epic video-players **NETFLIX** & **YOUTUBE**,
I call it a mixture.

For now, this is a simple video player template written in `typescript`, which
is only supported in desktop mode. This is still considered under-developed,
But will be soon released as a fully-functioning, well-working video player,
supporting rich features like streaming and HLS, along with prominent video
settings.

> **Note**: Please place your video file inside the `public/videos/` folder &
> then reference the video at `/src/components/VideoPlayer/index.tsx:222`

## TODO

- [X] An online demo.
